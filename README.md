Properties addon for gmod/darkrp, unupdated for years and turned into spaghetti code


The idea at the start was to remake the darkrp property system, allowing players to purchase houses and keep them.

Later, players requested to be able to rent the houses, have limits etc so instead of refactoring the whole code, i just patched it again and again.

And obviously it turned into spaghetti code.


This release, allows you to do pretty much what you want with it if you're not making money with it.

Only the people who bought it on gmodstore/scriptfodder are allowed to make money with it.

A much better version is available here : https://github.com/ExtReMLapin/ghomes

It fixes pretty much all the issues, better networking code, better math optimization for the rendering of the panel, no harcdoded stuff, every houses have it's own limite/variables/whatever, it's better in every aspects.

**Don't see this project as if i was proud of it, i'm not because the code is garbage**

The DLC wasn't really good but it boosted the sales of the main addon when i needed money to buy food :(
